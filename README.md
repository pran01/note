# Note

A note taking program that works on cmd.

I have created a python scrypt file and then transformed it into an executable.

Other instructions are given in the scrypt itself.

The name of the note and the note is pushed in a mysql database.

## Installing the databse

The mysql database and table for the program can be installed or rather created with the attatched sql file, preferrably with MySQL Workbench

## Connecting to the database

When you open the program, you need to enter the username and password for the MySQL server in which you have installed the required database.
